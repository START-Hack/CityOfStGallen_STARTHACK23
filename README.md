# START-Hack-CityOfStGallen-STARTHACK23

### Case Introduction
The challenge is about the optimization of re-using, recycling and removal of bulky waste:
In the city of St.Gallen, bulky waste that is marked with waste stamps can be left on the doorstep once a week. The waste is collected by the city's waste disposal unit the day it can be left on the doorstep. Waste stamps can only be obtained in person at certain sales points. Information on how many stamps must be affixed on a bulky item is specified on the city's website.
At the moment, it is difficult for the customers to estimate the correct quantity of waste stamps. Consequently, the responsible department has to put a lot of resources into handling service requests because of poor information and illegal waste disposal. Furthermore, the collected bulky waste always ends up in the waste incineration plant. This factor rule out any possible reuse or sharing of the material. 

This is a real world challenge, that we start tackling in this year. Help us to solving it by creating customer-oriented and smart solutions!

#### Expected Results:
The department for waste disposal is looking for innovative solutions on how the efficiency of the bulky waste disposal process could be increased in two dimensions: On the one hand, how it could become more customer-friendly for the population. And on the other hand, how administrational processes in the waste disposal department could be optimised regarding the procurement process of bulky waste stamps. Finally, the department is looking for possibilities to integrate sustainable concepts in the disposal of bulky waste in general. Can you find a solution for this challenge?

### Judging Criteria
We orient ourselves at the judging criteria of the START Hack which consists of the following criteria:
* Complexity & Technical Sophistication: Usage of appropriate services and technologies
* Design: Usability of the solution
* Viability: Possibility of realizing the solution
* Feasibility: Maturity Level of the developed solution
* Creativity & Innovation: surprise effect to the jury
* Presentation: Communication of the developed solution

However, St.Gallen needs to add one more criteria - **USEFULNESS**:

* Since it is a real world challenge, that we want to tackle this year, we need your solution to be useful
